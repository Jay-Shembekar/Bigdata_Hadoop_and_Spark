Spark Project - Market Analysis in Banking Domain

A Portuguese banking institution, ran a marketing campaign to convince potential customers to invest in a bank term deposit scheme. 

The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, the same customer was contacted more than once through phone, in order to assess if they would want to subscribe to the bank term deposit or not. 

This notebook is for practice purpose to perform the marketing analysis of the data generated by this campaign.
